# Interview Prep Assistant

This skill helps the user during live interviews by providing real-time intelligence in a stealthy manner.

## Capabilities
- **Live Transcription**: Captures both microphone and system audio (interviewer's voice) to transcribe the conversation in real-time.
- **Stealth HUD**: Displays transcripts and AI answers in a small, unobtrusive floating box (HUD) to avoid detection by the interviewer.
- **Context-Aware Answers**: Generates answers based on:
  - Uploaded Resume (PDF/DOCX)
  - Job Description
  - Pre-written Interview Script (Priority source)
- **Humanized Output**: Ensures AI responses are in the first-person POV ("I am...", "I have..."), natural, and conversational, avoiding robotic phrasing.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Ensure the `Interview-AI-Live` application is running.
2. **Context**: Upload the user's resume and the job description. Load any specific interview scripts.
3. **Audio**: Select "System Audio" to capture the interviewer's questions from the meeting platform (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.).
4. **Stealth Mode**: Use the HUD controls to position the answer box (e.g., Top-Center) near the camera to maintain eye contact.
